>intro1

You just finish reading the intro. Where would you like to go?
You just got a new skill! You can go places. Use 'i.go('place')'.
You can see all of your skills by 'i.skills()'.
Similarly, you can see the items you have in your possession by 'i.bag()'.
Type 'done' to exit a command loop.

>cmd1

Good job with your first command.
You are currently at {loc}.
What is that in the corner? It is a drone.
You just got a new skill! You can pick things up. Use 'i.add([thing])',
where [thing] is the item you want to add to your bag.

>drone1

You can control the drone by starting your commands with \'d.\'.            
For example, \'d.start()\' will launch the drone into a maze.
Control the drone with with .f(), .b(), .l(), .r()
Which correspond to forward, back, left, right
More powerful drones will be able to go up and down as well.

>pm_battle1

You are about to enter a battle.
You can get infomation about your pokemon through the pokedex.
Do 'pd.all_stats()' to get the stats of all pokemon.
Similarly, '[name].stats()' will give you the stats of a single pokemon,
where [name] is the name of a pokemon.
To see your currently active pokemon type 'pd.now()'.
And 'enemy' will give you a description of the current enemy pokemon.

>pm_battle2
# I don't really want to have '' in the call, but it's easier for now.

You can do one of three things on your turn:
attack, switch active pokemon, or use an item.
1. If you attack, you can use either a normal or special attack.
   Do either '[name].attack()' or '[name].sattack()'
   Special attacks __needs_to_be_implimented__
2. Switching is done by 'pd.switch(['name'])',
   where [name] is the pokemon you want to fight with.
3. Items __needs_to_be_implimented__
