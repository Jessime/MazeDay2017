# MazeDay2017

An RPG and collection of minigames for Maze Day 2017 at UNC.

# Usage
**Warning: This is subject to change.**

Development is being done in Python3(.5). If you don't have that installed, the easiest place to get it is from the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Each mini-game is currently run independently. Please refer to the README of the game you're interested in for specific instructions.

# Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull request if you have a feature you would like added. Most notably, we'll be taking any game submissions until approximately February. 
If you're interested in collaborating or need help getting set up, please send an email to jessime.kirk@gmail.com. We'll add you as a collaborator and get you setup on Slack.

## Adding a game
Each game should be given it's own directory. For example, if you're interested in contributing a "Call of Duty" clone, the directory structure should be:
```

└── src/
    └── call_of_duty_game/
        ├── tests/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── README.md
        └── call_of_duty.py

```
