Ideas on the table
==================

This is as of 2/16/17

1. Voltorb Flip, from pokemon
2. A simple pokemon battle game (seems hard to balance)
3. Something super basic but rewarding like [clickerheroes](https://www.clickerheroes.com).
4. Continue development on plants vs. zombies
5. Pinball (space cadets FTW!)
6. Follow the music in 3D space
